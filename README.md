# React Watch

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

# This Stopwatch is hosted at : https://osmanabdulmoomin.github.io/react-watch/
## To run the project on your device, navigate to the folder in your terminal and run yarn install, then yarn start.

# Tools used 
## React
### Hooks

This project takes advantage of and makes extensive use of React Hooks to "hook" into state and store stateful variables, like the time (calculated from centiseconds) and re-render the dom on updates. Using hooks rather than classes; increases the readability of the code (by keeping UI separate from logic which can make code look messy and hard to understand for other developers), allows components to be used elsewhere in the app easier  

### Material-UI

Google's Material-UI is a UI library, which provides components from React projects. I implemented Material in this project for a clean, sleek, up-to-date UI. 

## Git

I used Git for version control and hosting the finished project.

# Wishlist
  
  ### Implement graphics (something more stopwatch-esque, maybe make the watch itself round)
 ###  Implement animations (I've used anime.js in the past to implement animations in react; I could do the same here with each lap fading in as they're added)
  ### Implement sounds (Maybe a whistle when stopped)
